      <h3>My story</h3>
      <p>I’m Allen Postanes Aguiman, a student who didn’t exactly plan to get into tech at first. My first dream was to pursue aviation — I’ve always been fascinated by airplanes, airports, and the science behind flight. There’s something inspiring about how people can build massive machines that actually soar through the sky. But as I looked deeper into it, I realized that the aviation industry costs a lot, and the path to becoming a pilot or aviation professional isn’t simple. Because of that, I decided to take BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) as a backup plan, just to keep my options open while I figured things out.

At first, I didn’t expect much from tech. I thought it would just be about typing codes and following instructions. But as time went on, I found myself slowly getting drawn into it — learning how computers think, how websites are made, and how one small line of code can make a big difference. It felt challenging, but also satisfying in a way that reminded me of how I used to feel about planes. I started enjoying solving problems, experimenting with new ideas, and seeing my work actually come to life on screen.

Of course, it hasn’t been an easy journey. There are days when I get lazy, unmotivated, or completely stuck on a single bug for hours. But I’ve learned that those struggles are part of the process. Every small success, like making a webpage look better or fixing an error after countless tries, feels rewarding. My proudest moments aren’t from big achievements, but from those quiet times when I realize I’ve grown — when something that once confused me now makes perfect sense.

In the future, I hope to keep improving and discovering what I can really do in this field. I may have started BSIT as a backup plan, but it’s slowly turning into something I genuinely want to pursue. Whether it’s web development, design, or something else in tech, I want to create things that are both functional and meaningful — things that people can actually use and enjoy. I still carry my dream of aviation with me, but now I see technology as another way to reach new heights..</p>
